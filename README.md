# Tech Blog MVC

## Description

For this week it was my job to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This site was built completely from scratch and deployed to Heroku. The site uses express-handlebars, mysql2, sequelize, dotenv, bcrypt, express-session, and connect-session-sequelize packages.

Here is the link to the deployed page on Heroku: https://tech-blog-mvc-sevep.herokuapp.com/
